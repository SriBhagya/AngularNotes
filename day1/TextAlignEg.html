	<h1>introduction to DBMS</h1>
	<div class="div1">
		<p>Database Management System (DBMS)refers to the technology solution used to optimize and manage the storage and retrieval of data from databases. DBMS offers a systematic approach to manage databases via an interface for users as well as workloads accessing the databases via apps. The management responsibilities for DBMS encompass information within the databases, the processes applied to databases (such as access and modification), and the database’s logic structure. DBMS also facilitates additional administrative operations such as change management, disaster recovery, compliance, and performance monitoring, among others.
